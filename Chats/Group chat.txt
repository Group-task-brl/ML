10/7/23, 4:32â€¯PM - Tanu: *Subject: Instructions to Students about ST Exams*
*Attention, All Students,*
The upcoming Sessional Tests (ST) are of utmost importanceÂ as they serve as a critical assessment of your academic performance and directly contribute to your internal marks. These internal exam results can significantly influence your overall performance in the external exams. The internal assessmentÂ helps to give credit in the final assessment; it also reduces the burden and tension related to the final examination.Hence, it is absolutely imperative that you treat these exams with the utmost seriousness and dedication.Â All need to take care of the following:
*ST ATTENDANCE* - No Compromise: All need to understand how crucial it is for each and every one of you toÂ attend all ST examsÂ without fail. There will beÂ NO provision for re-examinationÂ under any circumstances. So, ensure you prepare diligently and make the most of this opportunity to excel in your academics.

*UNFAIR MEANS (UFM)*Â -Â Beware of the Consequences:Â Let this is a stern warning - any student found resorting to unfair means during the exams will face severe consequences. Carrying mobile phones, tablets, smart watches, or any form of unauthorized materials, such as written chits or papers, will not be tolerated. *Such actions will lead toÂ immediate imposition of a substantial monetary fine. Parents will also be intimated about UFM cases.* Additionally, students found guilty of UFM will be barred from appearing in the subsequent exam until they clear the imposed fine.Â 

*Best Wishes for Examinations!*

AICTE Approved institutions

Gentle Reminder!Â 
Greetings from AICTE !

As you are already aware that Yuva Sangam is Yuva Sangam is a flagship program of the Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat (EBSB) initiative, launched by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India. This initiative focuses on conducting exposure tours of the youths comprising mainly students studying in Higher Educational institutions (HEIs) & some off-campus youths from one state to other states & vice versa. It provides an immersive experience of various facets of life, development landmarks, recent achievements and a youth connect in the host state. The program aims to promote national integration and understanding by connecting youth from different parts of the country through educational and cultural exchanges.
Â 
In addition to the cultural exchange, Yuva Sangam also includes a number of other activities that are designed to help students develop their leadership, sports and soft skills. For example, students may get an opportunity not only to participate in workshops on leadership, communication, and teamwork but also sports events that may be organised by SAI. They will also have the opportunity to meet and interact with VVIPs, celebrities or important personalities of the host state.

The success of Yuva Sangam Phase 1 and 2 is a testament to the importance of investing in youth and building bridges between different communities. The program has had a positive impact on the lives of thousands of youth and has helped to build a more united and inclusive India.

I request your support in motivating students of your institution to register forÂ Yuva Sangam Phase-3, a student exchange program underÂ EBSB.

All interested students can register online atÂ https://ebsb.aicte-india.org/Â 

The registration process has started onÂ 18-10-2023Â and the last date isÂ 28-10-2023.

Please find attached a Concept note containing a brief about Yuva Sangam phase 1 and 2, eligibility criteria and also a document on how to inspire students to register for Yuva Sangam.
